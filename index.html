    <p>
        I hope this letter finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to express my thoughts and share some updates with you.
    </p>
    
    <p>
       This special connection of ours came unexpectedly. You entered my life in the most unexpected time, but, I never regret loving and meeting you. You made me feel what it feels like to be loved and to be treated right. Thank you for always loving me and choosing me. I don't know what can I do for you in exchange, but I want to assure you that I will always stay by your side. No matter what happens, you will always have a special place in my heart. 
    </p>
    
    <p><b>
       Thank you for being my safest and most peaceful place in this world full of chaos.
    </p></b>
